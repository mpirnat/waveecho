# waveecho

Play an audio clip every so often,
with adjustable volume.

This very simple project was inspired by
the Dungeons and Dragons adventure
"[The Lost Mine of Phandelver][lmop]",
which features a location called "Wave Echo Cave",
so named for the periodic sounds of crashing waves
echoing through its mysterious reaches.
I use it to heighten the audio experience for my players
without having to remember to push a button
every couple of minutes.
